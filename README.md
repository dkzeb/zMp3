# zMp3
Initial attempt to create a touch enabled/optimized Mp3 player for a small touch table device!

------------------------------------------
First changelog. So much is changing in the project, partly due to me not thinking it all the way through when i started coding the mp3 player (this was a learning project)

Rewrote almost the entire player - split the UI into 3 seperate files and 2 controllers - one for general UI and one for time related stuff, like updating the timer and the timeslider. 
Drag and Drop functionality was added to the librabry/playlist - and the player is mostly touch enabled already.

Began the tedious job of putting all the CSS into a css file instead of .style() tags. 

Thinking about making a fullfledged blog out of this process. :)
